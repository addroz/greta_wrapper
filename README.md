# GRETA Wrapper

Simple program loading and summarizing the data generated by GRETA. It produces a greta_summary.xlsx
file with the following information:
1. FLH for p30, p50, p70 and p90
2. Power Potential (GW)
3. Weighted Power Potential (GW)

For each country, type of energy source and height of the turbine (if applies).

# How to run

`python greta_wrapper.py`

# Config

Configurations available in config.py file:
1. COUNTRIES - list of countries to be included in the merged and grouped data.
2. TYPES - types of technologies.
3. SUBTYPES - additional dimension to differentiate within one technology, for example - height of a wind turbine. If there is no such dimension for a given type, a list of its subtypes should contain only 0.
4. YEAR - the year for which data is generated
5. PATH_TO_TS_FILE - path to the .csv file with TS data, given country, type and subtype
6. PATH_TO_STATS_FILE - path to the .csv file with stats data, given country, type and subtype
